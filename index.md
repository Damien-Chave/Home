Initially coming from technical training in electronics and home automation, I passed a complementing marketing and commerce master graduation. Following these studies, I traveled and worked in various professional environments with various positions qualifications, somewhat in Australia and in France (home country).


## Work illustration

The training from Coding Academy by Epitech included C language, HTML & CSS, Bootstrap, SQL, PHP, JavaScript (jQuery), MEAN stack, Laravel and Symfony frameworks. During the formation, some projects (made in short time, max 5 days/project) are released here on github, out of Epitech servers, to show you some of school exercises, and what I was able to do.
